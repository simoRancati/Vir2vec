Vir2vec is a pan-viral genomic language model (422M parameters) obtained by continual pretraining of Mistral-DNA on a curated corpus of 565,747 complete viral genomes spanning 295 species, producing reusable 4,096-dim genome-level embeddings. The paper also introduces vGUE, a unified benchmark to evaluate viral “genome understanding” across tasks from virus vs non-virus and DNA vs RNA to host prediction, HIV-1 vs HIV-2, SARS-CoV-2 lineage / influenza subtype typing, and HIV tropism, showing strong performance—especially on genome-wide and host-related tasks—using frozen embeddings plus shallow classifiers under nested CV.
